This the new release of wmlxgettext, rewritten from scratch in python 3.x.
Wmlxgettext is a python3 script that scans a list of .cfg (WML) and .lua files,
capturing all translatable string found in the files and creates a pot (.po) 
file.

From now on, the (old) perl script will be called "wmlxgettext 1.0", while the
new python3 script will be called "wmlxgettext 2.x"
