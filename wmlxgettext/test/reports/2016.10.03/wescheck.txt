wescheck.py originally allowed me to compare my (python) wmlxgettext results
agains PERL wmlxgettext result, creating diff files and error-log files.

The wescheck.py is enough good as it is, even if it assumes to compare a PERL
wmlxgettext (located under WESNOTH/utils directory) and PYTHON wmlxgettext
(under my repository structure, so under a sub-directory called wmlxgettext 
 from the one where wescheck.py is located)

The only change I really needed to perform was at wescheck.py line 75

cmd = [perl_wmlx, wesnothdir, domainname]

wich becomed

cmd = [perl_wmlx, wesnothdir, domainname, '--no-text-colors']

in order to disable text color codes from error messages in error log files
(wich are not uploaded in this test, they are useless for this test)

--------------------------------------

As I said before, wescheck.py assumes PERL vs PYTHON comparison.

What I did is:
* moved stable wmlxgettext (WITHOUT plural form) under WESNOTH/utils 
  (I remember: I tested under wesnoth 1.13.4 wich still had PERL wmlxgettext 
   as the default wmlxgettext tool)
  So this is the PYTHON version version BEFORE adding the plural support.
  Wescheck.py will label it as the 'perl' wmlxgettext
* runned wescheck.py from the plural branch of my wmlxgettext under my 
  repository. In this way wescheck.py will consider plural-support wmlxgettext
  as the PYTHON one.
  
In this way, the diff file produced will contain additions, subtractions and
modifications considering the STABLE wmlxgettext output files as the ORIGINAL 
ones, while considering the PLURAL FORM SUPPORTING wmlxgettext output files as
the files to very what differences will be produced from the original files.
